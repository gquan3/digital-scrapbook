<h2 align="center">Description</h3>
<p><b>☑️ Submission:</b> This is our submission to the GTHacks 2023 Hackathon event; it was submitted in the 🖌️ <b>digital art</b> 🖌️ category.</p>
<p><b>❓ About:</b> The project is a website where you can upload images, drag them into a digital scrapbook and store / organize them for storage of your memories!</p>
<p><b>🌠 Inspiration:</b> The inspiration for building this website came mostly from the theme of the hackathon which was "<b>memories</b>". We wanted to find a solution for capturing
and preserving memories and figured the best way to go about this was basing a website off of scrapbooking.</p>
<p><b>🌠🌠 Personal Inspiration (Xander):</b> There is a deeper reason why I like to participate in hackathons and it is for my love of learning! A hackathon is a perfect excuse to clear out
a weekend and learn a new skill, especially as an underclassman. This project in particular was inspired by my curiosity of web development and gave me a proper crash course in HTML, CSS, JS, and
website deployment. <br><b>Note:</b> that this project was built in 2 days by 2 people who have never written a line of code in any of the 3 languages above, <i>and it was alot of fun to try and put together. </i>😅</p>
<p><b>⚙️ How It Was Made:</b> The website was put together using HTML, CSS, and JS, and it was deployed using SpringBoot in Java.</p>
